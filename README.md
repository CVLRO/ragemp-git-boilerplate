# ragemp-gitlab-skeletonsrv
A boilerplate for the ragemp linux server with git

This doesn't include client_packages, which will be built for npm publish and then downloaded into the server with `npm install yourserver-clientpackage`.

**This is supposed to be used with gitlab, a linux vps and https://github.com/CVLRO/ragemp-gitlab-ci**
